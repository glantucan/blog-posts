# Photography Blog Content

This repository contains the content for my photography blog, including posts and images.

## Repository

This content is hosted at: https://github.com/glantucan/blog

## Structure

- `/posts` - Markdown files for blog posts
- `/images` - Image files referenced in blog posts

## Post Format

Posts should be written in Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
categories: ["category1"]
featuredImage: "/images/image-name.jpg"
---
```

## Image Guidelines

- Place all images in the `/images` directory
- Use relative paths in posts: `/images/image-name.jpg`
- Recommended image formats: JPG, PNG
- Optimize images before committing
